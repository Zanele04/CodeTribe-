                    <h2>My Journey</h2>
					
                    <p>My name is Zanele Joyce Nkosi. i was born in a rural area called Nhlazatshe in Mpumalanga province. I come from a disadvantaged background, but my experiences have shaped me into a resilient and determined individual. 
					Growing up, I faced numerous challenges, which fueled my desire to learn and improve my circumstances. I completed my matric in 2012, and I didnâ€™t stop there; I pursued my passion for technology by obtaining a Level 3 Certificate in Information Technology. <br><br> 
					Computers have always fascinated me. I find joy in coding and the endless possibilities it offers to create and innovate. This passion drives me to continuously learn and expand my skills in the tech world. <br><br> 
					I believe that with every line of code I write, I am not just solving problems; I am also building a brighter future for myself.
					Beyond my technical skills, I pride myself on being a good-hearted person. I am friendly and approachable, always willing to lend a helping hand to others. I believe in the power of kindness and strive to create a positive impact in the lives of those around me. 
					My eagerness to learn and my genuine care for others motivate me to grow both personally and professionally. I am excited about the opportunities ahead and look forward to contributing my skills and passion to meaningful projects in the tech industry.</p>
